# Seeds Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project implements a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification model to classify different types of seeds based on their physical measurements. The model is developed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook and is intended for educational and learning purposes.

## Project Overview

Seeds classification is a common machine learning problem used to demonstrate classification techniques on numerical datasets.  
In this project, the **KNN algorithm** is applied to classify seeds into different categories based on features such as area, perimeter, and shape-related measurements.

## Algorithm Used

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Supervised learning algorithm
- Classifies data based on similarity to nearest neighbors
- Distance-based (commonly Euclidean distance)
- Simple and effective for small to medium-sized datasets

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization, if used)
